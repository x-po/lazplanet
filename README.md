## About LazPlanet

LazPlanet is a blog full of interesting DIY projects, source codes and ideas that can be created in Lazarus IDE. In this blog you can find everything from a talking clock to a simple word processor or even a basic web browser that you can create in 3 minutes! LazPlanet is here since 2013 and is a great resource for beginners who want to start their programming journey in Lazarus or Free Pascal.

## Technical aspects

The blog is mainly made in Hexo (Node.js based static site generator) and the content is converted from the original platform into WordPress then converted into Hexo (as markdown). The conversion process is roughly described [here](https://notabug.org/adnan360/blogger-to-hexo). Currently the content is as is, after the conversion (so WIP). But this project is designed in such a way that it can be hosted in GitLab/GitHub pages or any [simple server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-server) that is able to serve static files.

As the site is static, the comments are not. So they had to be kept somewhere that dynamic languages are supported. [HashOver](https://www.barkdull.org/software/hashover) is a great project that lets anyone host their own comments and also supports [converting WordPress comments](https://github.com/kepon85/wp2hashover) into it.

The search feature is not implemented yet, but will be in future. All the self hosted solutions involve downloading the whole content index data into user machine and process it in browser. But it would be too much overhead for a simple feature. It could be somewhere around utilizing the GitLab search feature or having a dynamic language parse the dataset on some server and render the result on the site.
