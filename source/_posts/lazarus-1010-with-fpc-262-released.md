Another release of the 1.x stable version Lazarus 1.0.10 has been released. It has FPC 2.6.2 like its previous version. It is generally a bugfix version. It is good to see Lazarus releasing more updates for the stable version.
<!-- more -->
  
  
Lazarus is having more bugfix releases. Which the Lazarus community [agrees](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,21150.msg123485.html#msg123485) that even the paid Embarcadero / Delphi wasn't able to do. It is better to have a more stable version in the development process because it will have more reliability on the IDE, rather than just ruthlessly pushing the new features to the already buggy version (just like [Ubuntu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)) now a days).  
  
When the Lazarus gets more bug-free, the applications compiled with it gets bug-free too. Because Lazarus uses the same LCL (components) in the compiled executables used in the project. (We know that Lazarus is made with Lazarus itself, right?)  
  
  
Thanks to the Lazarus Developers for their hard work in this valuable project.
