Zooming is kind of fun! Here is a 5 minute image zoom tutorial with mouse scroll fun!
<!-- more -->

We have 2 nifty events named **OnMouseWheelUp** and **OnMouseWheelDown** to tell when the user scrolled his mouse wheel.

Zooming is basically stretching the image to place it in a bigger area than the original. then the image looks bigger. We can use **StretchDraw** for this.

We can combine these 2 and you will be seeing a result before you know it!

### Tutorial


Start [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/).

Create a new Application Project (**Project -> New Project -> Application -> OK**).

Draw a **TImage** (from **Additional** tab). Set a picture of your choice as its `Picture` property.

Draw a **TScrollBar**. Set its **HorzScrollbar -> Tracking** and **VertScrollbar -> Tracking** property to **True**.


Draw a **TPaintbox** inside the **TScrollbox** (start drawing from inside the **TScrollbox** to achieve this). Place it in the most top left position (or set `Top` to `0`, `Left` to `0`).


Now switch to **F12** to go to **Code View**. Add the following line just under the line `TForm1 = class(TForm)`:

```pascal
procedure DrawImage;
```

Put your cursor on the line and press **Ctrl+Shift+C**. This should elaborate the procedure automatically for you to write something in it. Write something like this:

```pascal
procedure TForm1.DrawImage;
var
  ImageRect: TRect;
begin
  ImageRect := Rect(0,0,(Image1.Picture.Width * ScaleFactor), (Image1.Picture.Height * ScaleFactor) );
  PaintBox1.Width := ImageRect.Right;
  PaintBox1.Height := ImageRect.Bottom;
  PaintBox1.Canvas.StretchDraw(ImageRect, image1.Picture.Bitmap);
end;
```

Just under the `Form1: TForm1;` line, insert this code:

```pascal
  ScaleFactor:integer;
```

Now switch to Form View (**F12**). Double click the form and enter:

```pascal
procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  ScaleFactor:=1;
end;
```

We will set the default `ScaleFactor` to `1` to show the image as is at first when it loads. Then we manipulate the value to enlarge the image.

Now go to Form View (**F12**). Select the **TPaintBox**. Go to **Events** and click the `[...]` button next to `ScrollWheelDown` and enter:

```pascal
procedure TForm1.ScrollBox1MouseWheelDown(Sender: TObject; Shift: TShiftState;
  MousePos: TPoint; var Handled: Boolean);
begin
  // we don't want it to be less than 1
  if ScaleFactor > 1 then begin
     ScaleFactor:=ScaleFactor-1;
     DrawImage;
  end;
end;
```

Now again Go to **Events** and click the **[...]** button next to `ScrollWheelUp` and enter:

```pascal
procedure TForm1.ScrollBox1MouseWheelUp(Sender: TObject; Shift: TShiftState;
  MousePos: TPoint; var Handled: Boolean);
begin
  // we allow 50 times zoom!
  if ScaleFactor < 50 then begin
     ScaleFactor:=ScaleFactor+1;
     DrawImage;
  end;
end;
```

These two above will control the mouse wheel scroll events. When the Wheel will scroll up it will zoom in and zoom out when scrolling down.

Lastly, select **PaintBox1**, go to **Events** once again. Click the **[...]** button next to `OnPaint`. Now enter:

```pascal
procedure TForm1.PaintBox1Paint(Sender: TObject);
begin
  DrawImage;
end;
```

This simple code will update the image when it is needed. Especially when it needs redraw (resize the window, minimize/restore, hide/show the window etc.)


#### Run it!

Now run the project (**F9** or **Run -> Run**).

This would show your shiny new form on your screen ready to be played with.

This is just a quick example of how to use mouse scroll and image stretching in simple code. You can enhance it if you like.
