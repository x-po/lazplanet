This release is generally a bug fix release. The most important thing is that this version supports FPC 2.6.2. So no more installing FPC yourself! And the loading time is freakin' fast!

### What's new in Lazarus

If you are eager to see many new functions then this version will not satisfy you that much. This is basically a bug fix release. The major thing is that it has Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) version 2.6.2, the latest stable version till date.  
  
Another thing is that, UPX is no  longer being shipped with FPC. The versions of FPC greater than 2.6.0 has no UPX included. But UPX can be used by downloading it from: [upx.sourceforge.net](http://upx.sourceforge.net/)

For instructions on how to use UPX with the newer FPCs, [check out here](http://lazplanet.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-to-reduce-exe-file-size-of-your.html).  
  
Besides that, the loading time is very fast. It loads about one third the time of loading time of 1.0.6! it is a significant speed increase.  
  

Many Bugs are fixed in this release. For details [click here](http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/User_Changes_2.6.2).
