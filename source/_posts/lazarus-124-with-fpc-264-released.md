Lazarus 1.2.4 has been released. It is the second version with FPC 2.6.4. It is basically a bug fix release but worth upgrading.
<!-- more -->
  
  
Lazarus is getting bug-free everyday. Here is another stable release of Lazarus - version 1.2.4. It has FPC 2.6.4. The previous version 1.2.2 also had this version of FPC. This version has many new bug fixes. You can look at the [changes here](http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Lazarus_1.2_fixes_branch#Fixes_for_1.2.4_.28Merged.29).  
  
1.2.2 version seems to be having some issues while I was using it. Some features worked slow. I hope this version would be problem free. It is better to upgrade to the latest stable to get a stable environment. If you can, you should upgrade.  
  
The look is similar to Lazarus version 1.2. No huge change there...
