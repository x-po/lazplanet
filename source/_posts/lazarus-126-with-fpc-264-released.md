![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oA9UpWFum6w/Ubtes8bszUI/AAAAAAAABB0/R2a6EWkKgeE/s1600/Lazarus-Logo.png)Lazarus 1.2.6 has been released. It is the third version with FPC 2.6.4. It is basically a bug fix release but worth upgrading.  
  
  
Lazarus is getting bug-free everyday. Here is another stable release of Lazarus - version 1.2.6. It has FPC 2.6.4. The previous version 1.2.4 also had this version of FPC. This version has many new bug fixes. You can look at the [changes here](http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Lazarus_1.2_fixes_branch#Fixes_for_1.2.6_.28Merged.29).  
  
Lazarus 1.2.6 is a better version than 1.2.4 because many bugs have been fixed and recommended to upgrade. As previous versions, this version also allow multiple instances of Lazarus running on Windows. [People have been telling](http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,26134.msg160016.html#msg160016) that Lazarus 1.2.6 also works with Wine under Linux. That's definitely great to hear.  
  
The look of this version is similar to the previous version of Lazarus. No real change there...

At the end, a thousand thanks to the Lazarus Developers for their hard work in this valuable project.
