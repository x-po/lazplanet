There are many calculator programs out there... with hundreds of buttons to click and thousands of lines of codes to implement those functions. But in this little project we discover a simple calculator...by hand...
<!-- more -->


We have 4 Buttons for calculation and 2 Editboxes for entering numbers. That's it. We just implement the addition, subtraction, multiplication, devision with two numbers. Should be easy.


### Concept

Simply if we have two variables like these having numbers:

```pascal
  num1: single = 20;
  num2: single = 10;
```

and a variable for holding the result:

```pascal
  MyResult: single = 0;
```
then we can do the calculations very easy:

```pascal
// addition
MyResult := num1 + num2;  // returns: 30

// subtraction
MyResult := num1 - num2;  // returns: 10

// multiplication
MyResult := num1 \* num2;  // returns: 200

// division
MyResult := num1 / num2;  // returns: 2
```

It is simple!
Just look at the arithmetic operators in the [free pascal manual](http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/refsu39.html):

We know `+` and `-` for addition and subtraction. But in computers `*` is used for multiplication and `/` for division for easier access from keyboard.

We have a layout in the project like this:

The user inputs two numbers in the first two Editboxes, then presses a button for the result to be shown. The project code contains error handling code and thus may look complicated at first. But let's break down the code in simple parts and look at a simplified version.


### Simple Example

It is better if you create a new Project (**Project -> New Project -> Application -> OK**) and go with this explanation to try out the examples to learn practically. This will improve your learning. Add 3 **TEditbox**es and make their **Text** property to zero (by selecting the Editboxes and click on Text property and replacing the default value, e.g. `Edit1`, `Edit2`, with `0`). Name the editboxes **edtNum1**, **edtNum2** and **edtResult**. **edtNum1** and **edtNum2** will contain our two numbers. We can also add 4 **TButtons** in the form and naming them accordingly (e.g. **btnAdd**, **btnSubtract**, **btnMultiply**, **btnDivision**).

Then double click btnAdd and enter:

```pascal
var
  res: single = 0;
begin
  res := StrToFloat(edtNum1.Text) + StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text);
  edtResult.Text := FloatToStr( res );
end;
```

### Explanation

Now the explanation:

```pascal
res: single = 0;
```

We could have used integer types. But we use single type because we want to have decimal places.

```pascal
StrToFloat(edtNum1.Text)
```

`Editbox.Text` property returns a string. We cannot calculate with string value, because strings are character types. They contain characters. Character can be a letter or a number or anything else that you can type.

Even if they have numbers in the input, they are in the character form. So we would have to convert the strings to numeric type (so that we can do our calculations). So we used `StrToFloat()` (which means "Convert String type To Float Type") to convert the `edtNum1.Text` to a numeric type. Same goes for **edtNum2**:

```pascal
StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text)
```

After we have converted String to Float, with `StrToFloat()`, we can do our calculation:

```pascal
StrToFloat(edtNum1.Text) + StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text)
```

...and we store our result in a **Single** typed variable named `res`:

```pascal
  res := StrToFloat(edtNum1.Text) + StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text);
```

Now we have to show the result in **edtResult**. `edtResult.Text` is a string type property, so it will only accept string as a value. So we'd have to convert our numeric result into a string in order to show it on `edtResult`. So we write:

```pascal
  edtResult.Text := FloatToStr( res );
```

`FloatToStr()` converts our Float (Single) value to a string. So we are now able to set the float as the `Text` property of **edtResult**.

We can do the same with the rest of the buttons:

For subtraction:

```pascal
var
  res: single = 0;
begin
  res := StrToFloat(edtNum1.Text) - StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text);
  edtResult.Text := FloatToStr( res );
end;
```

For Multiplication:

```pascal
var
  res: single = 0;
begin
  res := StrToFloat(edtNum1.Text) * StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text);
  edtResult.Text := FloatToStr( res );
end;
```

For Division:

```pascal
var
  res: single = 0;
begin
  res := StrToFloat(edtNum1.Text) / StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text);
  edtResult.Text := FloatToStr( res );
end;
```

The only thing that differs between the button commands is that the operator has been changed. So, it's simple! Right?!


### Caution

In case of division we have to make sure that no 0 (zero) gets as the second value for the calculation. If it does, the application will face a crash! An error message will shut the application down.

We know that we cannot use zero as the second value but the users don't know that. They can accidentally or unintentionally enter 0 as value and face an application crash. So we will have to implement an error handling. It can be done like this:

```pascal
var
  res: single = 0;
begin

if (StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text) = 0) then begin
  edtResult.Text := '(ERROR)';
end else begin
  res := StrToFloat(edtNum1.Text) / StrToFloat(edtNum2.Text);
  edtResult.Text := FloatToStr( res );
end

end;
```

Also, we can use `Val()` function to ensure that no character gets in to our calculation. `Val()` works like this: `Val()` needs three values. `Val()` tries to convert the first value (a string) to an integer (second value which is a numeric variable). If it fails, (that means if it finds a character which is not a number), it returns the position of that non-numeric character. So if it returns 0 then we have no errors, so it is a number. But if it returns non-zero value then we will have to show errors.

If we want to implement this in the above example then it will become too messy and complicated. So we will have to redesign the way we coded this application. That's why you need to see the code sample zip given below.

We implemented a `ValidateInput()` function to return false if inputs have invalid characters. And if the inputs are valid, the inputs are stored in `Num1` and `Num2` variables of `Single` type. This validation check is done before every calculation. And we have the same `OnClick` event procedure for all the four buttons, but the buttons have their separate `Tag` property to identify which button is clicked.

For example the `Tag` property of the **Add** button is `1`. So in the `CalculateMe` function we have something like:

```pascal
      if Index = 1 then
        MyResult := num1 + num2
```

Here, the `Index` variable contains the `Tag` value.

Good luck on your journey! Have your own calculators made!
