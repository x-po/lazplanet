Suppose you have found a huge paragraph. How many words are in that paragraph? Do you want to count yourself? No. We can let our program count the words! Here's how...
<!-- more -->


The [strutils](http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/strutils/index-5.html) unit has an useful function: [wordcount](http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/strutils/wordcount.html)

The syntax is:

```pascal
function WordCount(
  const S: ;
  const WordDelims: TSysCharSet
):Integer;
```

It counts the words in a given string.

Remember? Some criteria for essay/article writing may require the word count to be something between **x** and **y**? It is very common to limit the length of an article through word count, so that teachers or readers are not irritated with huge text.

Now, how can you count words in a sentence, or a paragraph, or even a bunch of paragraphs? Well, we will use the function above. The tricky part is in the `WordDelims` (or short for "Word Delimiters"). Delimiters are the characters which are not part of the words (e.g. space character).


### Quick Tutorial

Create a new Application project. **Project -> New Project -> Application -> OK**.

Drop a **TMemo** and a **TLabel** in the form. Select the **Memo** and set its **ScrollBars** to **ssVertical**. Then double click the Memo and write:

```pascal
Label1.Caption := IntToStr(WordCount(Memo1.Lines.Text, [' '])) + ' Words';
```

`WordCount` returns the word count as an integer. We use `IntToStr` for converting the line count to string in order to show it in `Label1.Caption`. And we add the word ` Words` at the end of the count. The `[' ']` part adds a space character as a delimiter. We could add a `TSysCharSet` variable and then use this in the delimiter part too. (See the final example.)

Don't forget to add `strutils` in the `uses` clause:

```pascal
uses
  ..., strutils, ...;
```

Now **Run** the Project (**F9** or **Run -> Run**). Write some words in the Memo. You will see the count in the Label.

Now the problem is that when you use a new line, the word count is not right. For example enter:
```
I
am
```

That should return 2, but it returns 1. This is because we've set a single space character as the delimeter. But there is no space character in between the two words. There are character `#13` and `#10` in between (for new line). So we have to add it in the delimiter. (Remember, that Unix and Unix based OSs \[e.g.Mac OS X, Linux\] do not have `#10` for new line.) We can modify the code as below:

```pascal
var
  Delimeters:TSysCharSet;
begin
  Delimeters := [' ', '.', ',', (#13)];
  Label1.Caption := IntToStr(WordCount(Memo1.Lines.Text, Delimeters)) + ' Words';
end;
```

We have added 4 characters as delimiters. You can add more such as, `( ) - @ = : / ;` etc.

You can add other components to decorate the form. Such as another **TLabel** with **Caption** `You have typed: `. May be implement resize **Anchors** to change size of the memo when the form is resized. But these are minor things.
