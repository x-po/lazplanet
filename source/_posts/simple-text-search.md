Searching is one of the tasks of programing that reduces so much of our work and hardship. Today we see a **very** simple string search sample code...
<!-- more -->
  
For second variation/update of this program [see this article](http://lazplanet.blogspot.com/2013/04/search-text-all-words.html).  
  
Text search is very easy through a function named [PosEx](http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/strutils/posex.html) from the strutils unit. The function is given a substring (which part we want to search) and a string (which is the _whole text_ in which we search).  
  
There are many syntax. We would need this syntax:  
  
  

function PosEx(  
  
  const SubStr: ;  
  
  const S:  
  
):Integer;

  
You can test this function with a code like this:  

Ret = PosEx('pet', 'I have a big pet dinosaur');

  
Ret would return 14, as the text 'pet' is found on 14th position of the given string.  

### Quick Tutorial

Create a new Application Project. Project->New Project->Application->OK.  
Create a TMemo, a TEdit, and a TButton. Select the memo and set its Scrollbars to ssAutoVertical.  
Add strutils to the uses clause:  

uses  
..., strutils;

  
Double click the button and write the following code:  

var  
  
  findpos: integer;  
  
begin  
  
  // find the occurance of the text  
  
  findpos := PosEx(Edit1.Text, Memo1.Text);  
  
  
  
  // we start our selection  
  
  Memo1.SelStart := findpos - 1;  
  
  // we set the length of our selection  
  
  Memo1.SelLength := Length(Edit1.Text);  
  
  
  
  // we set focus to memo to show the selection to  
  
  // the user  
  
  Memo1.SetFocus;  
  
end;  

  

### Explanation

Memo1.SelStart := findpos - 1;

  

SelStart is 0-based (starts from 0). PosEx on the other hand is 1-based (starts from 1). So findpos is 1-based. We -1 from findpos to make it zero-based, for SelStart.

### Run It

Go to Run->Run. Write something in the memo and then write something in the editbox then click the button.
