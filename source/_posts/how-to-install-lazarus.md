Below is a guide of how to install Lazarus in Windows and Ubuntu (Linux).

### Installing Lazarus in Windows

Installing Lazarus in Windows is the easiest. Follow these steps below:


#### Step-1: Download Lazarus for Windows

[Download Lazarus from here (32 bit)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/Lazarus%20Windows%2032%20bits/). It is normally 32 bit version that works for all. But If you have a 64 Bit OS then [Go here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/Lazarus%20Windows%2064%20bits/). If you are blocked from SourceForge.net then try [here](http://mirrors.iwi.me/lazarus/), [here](ftp://freepascal.dfmk.hu/pub/lazarus/releases/), or [here](http://michael-ep3.physik.uni-halle.de/Lazarus/releases/).



Click on the Latest version folder directory. For example, the current version while writing this article is [1.0.8](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,20297.0.html). So we are going to "Lazarus 1.0.8" directory.

Now click on the `lazarus-x.x.x-fpc-x-win32.exe` or `...win64.exe` (x is the version number) link. Be careful not to download the winCE version.



#### Step-2: Install

Double click the downloaded .exe file and install it like any other software. Here's a more detailed view:

Notice that Lazarus is installed in `C:\Lazarus` directory. You can choose any other drives if you want (like `D:\Lazarus`) but you should not install it in a folder with spaces in its name (such as `C:\lazarus ide`).

The rest of the installation is self-explanatory. For starters, it is better that you select **Full Installation**.

You can keep a shortcut in the desktop or not. ;-)

The install will take a couple of minutes. After all it is installing more than 700 MB of data.

Click Finish, and the installation is complete.

### Installing \*Latest\* Lazarus in Ubuntu (or any other Linux)

Here we look into the steps of installing Lazarus in Ubuntu. This guide has been tested in Ubuntu version 12.04 LTS but should work on other versions and other debian based distros as well. If your distro is RPM based, you can [follow instructions here](http://wiki.freepascal.org/Installing_Lazarus#Installing_using_rpms). If you face any trouble, post a comment and let us know. ;)

You can always run **sudo apt-get install lazarus** in terminal to install Lazarus from the Ubuntu Repository. But the version you will get is probably backdated. So read this guide to install the latest Lazarus:


#### Step-1: Downloading

[Go here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/files/), or [here](http://mirrors.iwi.me/lazarus/). Then click "Lazarus Linux i386 DEB" (or Lazarus Linux amd64 DEB if you use 64 bit). Then click the latest version link, for example "Lazarus 1.0.8"


![Download the 3 files necessary for the installation](how-to-install-lazarus/download-lazarus2.gif "Download the 3 files necessary for the installation")


Download the 3 .deb files that are available. For example, `fpc_2.6.2-0_i386.deb`, `fpc-src_2.6.2-0_i386.deb`, `lazarus_1.0.8-0_i386.deb`. (The filenames may differ based on the version chosen.)

**NOTE:** Since Lazarus 2.0, the `fpc` debian package has been renamed to `fpc-laz`. It's the same, just a name change. Please use `fpc-laz` instead for 2.0 or later versions.

Save those 3 files in a separate folder. It will help you in the installation process.


#### Step-2: Installing

If you already have lazarus installed then uninstall it first.

Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal. Run the following commands to uninstall:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge fpc lazarus
sudo rm -Rf /usr/lib/fpc
sudo rm -Rf /usr/lib/lazarus
sudo rm -Rf /usr/share/fpcsrc
sudo rm -f ~/.fpc
sudo rm -Rf ~/.lazarus
```

Now we are going to install Lazarus. Type `cd` followed by a space.

Drag the folder (inside which you have saved the 3 `.deb` files) in the terminal window. Press enter.

Then run:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

You will probably see a message saying that some library is not installed (such as `libgtk2.0-dev`). Install the dependent libraries. For example,

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
```

Then run the above command again

```bash
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

Now it is going to install. It takes a bit of a time. It will require about 1.5 GB of space in your linux partition to install Lazarus in Linux.

To run lazarus you can use the dash menu or on a command prompt run `startlazarus`. When Lazarus runs, you can right click the Launcher icon of Lazarus and Click "Lock to Launcher". It will place the Lazarus icon in the Launcher for your convenience.
