Can't get enough of JSONs? Crunch some JSON data with this simple code!
<!-- more -->


[JSON](http://wiki.freepascal.org/JSON) is a very common data format now a days, especially in various APIs. [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or [JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org/) is a comma seperated data format. It is easy for the humans to read & write. It is easy for the machines to read & write. So it's a very good format to put data in. See this example and you'll get the idea:

```json
{
    "name1": value1,
    "name2": value2
}
```

As you can see, the key is written in quotes followed by a colon (:) sign, followed by a value. This is the basic structure. It's an example straight from the [wiki](http://wiki.freepascal.org/JSON). Here's another one from the wiki:

```json
{"user":
    {   "userid": 1900,
        "username": "jsmith",
        "password": "secret",
        "groups": [ "admins", "users", "maintainers"]
    }
}
```

Seems complex at first. But as you can see, it is very straight forward. It is fairly simple, especially when compared to other text based data structures such as [XML](http://wiki.freepascal.org/XML_Tutorial). Oh boy! Newbies have a nightmare writing XML codes. Those sharp-edged, pointy angle brackets are not something which is easy to their eyes!

But JSON is very simple. It can be broken down into several points:

- When you want to write a group of data, you use curly brackets ( `{...}` ).
- The whole data is considered as a group and so it is **enclosed in 2 curly brackets**, always. (Even when there is only one name/value pair.)
- Then you write **names** of values and then **values**. You separate them with a colon (`:`)
- If you write a string anywhere, use double quotes ( `"..."` ). And if you write numeric data, don't use it.


That's it! So simple.

How about a simple pascal example to go with it? Okey, let's get to it!


### 2 Lines Code Example

Start [Lazarus](http://lazarus.freepascal.org/). Create a new Application Project (**Project -> New Project -> Application -> OK**).

Switch to Code View (**F12**). Add `fpjson` and `jsonparser` to the `uses`. These are units which has functions to work with JSON.

```pascal
uses
  ..., fpjson, jsonparser;
```

Now switch to Form View (**F12 again**). Now double click the form and enter the following code:

```pascal
procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
var
  json: String;
  J: TJSONData;
begin
  // We hold our json data in a string.
  // The variable "json" is a string type.
  // We can also use TJSONStringType instead of string.
  json:='{"user":'+
    '{   "userid": 1900,'+
        '"username": "jsmith",'+
        '"password": "secret",'+
        '"groups": [ "admins", "users", "maintainers"]'+
    '}'+
  '}';

  // We send our JSON data to TJSONData. This is line 1 of our code.
  J:=GetJSON(json);

  // We show the username from the data
  // FindPath returns TJSONData
  // So we use .AsString to convert it to string. This is line 2.
  Caption :=  J.FindPath('user.username').AsString;
end;
```

So you see it! We have a perfectly working example of JSON parsing with barely 2 lines of code. Lazarus is that good!

Now go ahead and Run the project (**F9** or **Run -> Run**). You will see **jsmith** in the titlebar of your form. Neat!


### Extending the example

We have seen a basic example. Now its time to extend it. We will build a program to let us paste json data in it and query different paths. This will help us test various API responses and get a good idea which path will work best for us.

So, go ahead and create a new Application Project (**Project -> New Project -> Application -> OK**). That's easy!

Now, as before, add `fpjson` and `jsonparser` to the `uses`:

```pascal
uses
  ..., fpjson, jsonparser;
```

Switch to Form view and draw 2 `TMemo`s. `Memo1` should be on the left and `Memo2` should be on the right. Set their `ScrollBars` property to `ssAutoVertical` from Object Inspector in order for them to be scrollable. You can use `TGroupBox`es to decorate the form any way you like.

Now draw a `TEdit` and a `TButton` on the form. They should appear as `Edit1` and `Button1`. Change their name as `edtPath` and `btnParse` to have a identifiable layout. Use any `TLabels` if you think they are appropriate, even a `TGroupBox` is good. My form looks like this:


![](a-simple-json-parsing-example/JSON-parser-1.gif)


You can set some default values. For that change the `Memo1`'s Lines as the code below:

```json
{"user":
    {   "userid": 1900,
        "username": "jsmith",
        "password": "secret",
        "groups": [ "admins", "users", "maintainers"]
    }
}
```

Set `edtPath`'s `Text` property as: `user.username`
And blank out the `Memo2`'s `Text` property.

And you may want to change `Form1`'s `Caption` as well, if you wish.

Now your form may look like this:


![](a-simple-json-parsing-example/JSON-parser-2.gif)


Now double click the button and enter:

```pascal
procedure TForm1.btnParseClick(Sender: TObject);
var
  J: TJSONData;
begin
  // Parse JSON Data to TJSONData
  J:=GetJSON(Memo1.Text);
  // Get the value for the path in edtPath
  Memo2.Text:=J.FindPath(edtPath.Text).AsString;
end;
```

Again, only 2 lines of code does the trick!

Now Run it (**F9** or **Run -> Run**).


![](a-simple-json-parsing-example/JSON-parser-cross-platform-lazarus.gif)


Now click the **Parse** button. You should see `jsmith` in the Result. It works graciously. But what if the path does not exist? Try out with some random path and you will see a `SIGSEGV` error.

To fix it, add a [simple `try ... except` block](http://wiki.freepascal.org/Logging_exceptions#Manual_exception_handling) in your code, like this:

```pascal
procedure TForm1.btnParseClick(Sender: TObject);
var
  J: TJSONData;
begin

  try
    // Parse JSON Data to TJSONData
    J:=GetJSON(Memo1.Text);
    // Get the value for the path in edtPath
    Memo2.Text:=J.FindPath(edtPath.Text).AsString;

  except
    on E: Exception do ShowMessage('Error finding path!');

  end;

end;
```

You will not see the message when running from inside Lazarus. To test it, save the project somewhere and run it from Lazarus, then double click the .exe / executable from the file explorer. Then enter a random string to test if the message box appears.

Now you are ready parse some serious JSON goods!
