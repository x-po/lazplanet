Lazarus 1.8 has been released. It is the first version with FPC 3.0.4. It has many visible and under the hood changes.
<!-- more -->
  
As a fan it seems this version took the longest to release! Another stable version of the Lazarus of version 1.8, with FPC 3.0.4 has been announced on 7 December 2017. Some major changes include:  
  

*   Qt5 based new widgetset
*   High DPI option for LCL components
*   TToolButton to use arrows beside buttons
*   Some Clipboard and Menu improvements
*   [and many more...](http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Lazarus_1.8.0_release_notes)

  
The look has been changed slightly. The toolbar button icons have changed.

Menu icons as well. It certainly looks more professional than before...

Also, I notice that the previous { public declarations } and { private declarations } are no more. That's a serious change for beginners, but I think professionals will like it.  
  
I'm sure there are many more changes out there. Feel free to explore!  
  
At the end, a thousand thanks to the Lazarus Developers for their hard work in this valuable project.
