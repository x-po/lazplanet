### Tutorials

Free Pascal is the key to a good Lazarus programing skill. After all, Free Pascal is the language which Lazarus depends on. When you learn Free Pascal very well you can build softwares at an impressive speed and you can convert even C or C++ libraries to Freepascal. You can create anything from powerful algorithms to graphics editing/3D softwares. So let's get started:


#### Freepascal Resources

A very good free pascal tutorial series: [http://www.taoyue.com/tutorials/pascal/contents.html](http://www.taoyue.com/tutorials/pascal/contents.html) or in the wiki format: [http://wiki.freepascal.org/Object_Pascal_Tutorial](http://wiki.freepascal.org/Object_Pascal_Tutorial)

I love [this tutorial series](http://pascal-programming.info/lesson1.php). Although it is written for Pascal, but it is a great way to learn Free Pascal as well.

Another favorite of mine is this one: [Tutorials Point Pascal Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/index.htm). There is also a [PDF version](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/pascal_pdf_version.htm) available if you are interested.

Marco Cantù is the writer of the book "Mastering Delphi", which is the best selling book on Delphi. The book's newer versions ommited the part for Object Pascal which was included in earlier versions. So, that part is offered for free here: [Marco Cantù's Essential Pascal](http://www.marcocantu.com/epascal/English/default.htm) . I enjoyed reading it. So I think you will too.

PDF Ebook on Object Pascal from:
[Start Programing Object Pascal](http://code.sd/startprog/StartProgUsingPascal.pdf)

[SwinBrain Pascal Tutorial](http://swinbrain.ict.swin.edu.au/wiki/Pascal#Pascal_Development_Tools)

Coding Style Guide to help you format your code better: [Object Pascal Style Guide](http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/10280)
